# pyHW

Python API's to hardware components, modules, and RPI-project based helpers.

Don't forget to set the absolute path to the 'helpers' and 'HAL'

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/repository/helpers/:/path/to/repository/helpers/

At this stage, it's a bit of a mess and work-in-progress.

HALTemplate.py is a rough example of how to use these current APIs.
